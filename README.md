Employees ERD.png contains the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) I have created based on looking at the data that was given to me.

In the folder named "EmployeeSQL", it contains two SQL files and afolder named, "Data", containing all the excel files (CSV files) for the assignment.
The first SQL file named, "Employee_tables", contains all the coding I have done to create the tables needed for the excel files inside the Data folder. I manually imported the data into each tabled via the import function in pgAdmin 4 and specifying the path to the correct CSV file.
Also including inside my code, I have also added, "SELECT * FROM Table name", to display each table and to show that the tables have been created correctly with the right columns and to show, the data has been imported correctly.
The second SQL file named, "Empplyees_queries", contains all the coding I have done to get the information that was required of me to display in SQL.
